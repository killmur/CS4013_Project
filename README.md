Running the program:

In order to run the program, simply navigate to the Run.java class, and run the class or main() function. After this you can follow the CLI instructions.

You can view the CSVs in the data folder to get employee names (employees.csv), supported salary positions and scales (salaryScales.csv) , to check if the pay claim system works (payClaims.csv), and to see the payslips currently generated (and to check new ones) - (all_payslips.csv).

The functions are all outlined in the java doc.
